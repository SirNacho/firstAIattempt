# first AI attempt
## Created on August 2022.
This is the first attempt at a voice assistant. I created the code when I was 18 and I'm uploading to github as a showcase to how I grow in computer science. Feel free to use some parts of the codes for other projects.
I would also like to give a shout out to neuralintents for helping me understand how to make a voice assistant.
